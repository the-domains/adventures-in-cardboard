I just watched the [first review][0] of [Star Wars: Rebellion][1] and it totally confirmed the opinion I had first formed after hearing about it on the Dicetower Podcast. This seems to be an amazing, epic, cinematic game that captures everything from the original movie trilogy in the same way that [War of the Rings][2] captured that trilogy. I can't wait to get my hands on it and play it to death.
