I just watched the [first review][0] of [Star Wars: Rebellion][1] and it totally confirmed the opinion I had first formed after hearing about it on the [Shut Up And Sit Down Podcast][2]. This seems to be an amazing, epic, cinematic game that captures everything from the original movie trilogy in the same way that [War of the Rings][3] captured that trilogy. I can't wait to get my hands on it and play it to death.
