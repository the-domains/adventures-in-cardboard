After an easily won game of  [Pandemic][0] before dinner, my wife agreed that we are finally ready to tackle the awesome epicness of [Pandemic Legacy][1], currently rated as the [world's best board game][2]. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/82c9c282-4514-4304-ba73-da6707c7ff50.jpg)

This means that our next game will probably feel exactly like our last (the first game of Legacy is played by standard Pandemic rules), but after that, the bandages are off.

**Update: **January didn't really go as planned. The legacy-twist in the middle of the game took us by surprise, so we lost the game and ended up with some damaged cities on the board. Let's see how the late January game will go.
