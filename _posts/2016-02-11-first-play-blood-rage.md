I'm in currently playing my first round of Blood Rage. I'm playing both hand of a two player game to get a feeling for the rules and the interaction of the mechanisms in order to better teach the game to my group. So far, and from all the reviews and live plays I've seen, it's a spectacular game, but I don't think two is the best player count. I'll set up a three player game next and see how this goes.
